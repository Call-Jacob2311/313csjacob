                    <span>Welcome to GamerBase! This is a version one of my project for CS 313. 
                    Right now GamerBase is simple a plateform where you can add games to your collection. I had a whole team in my other class drop another class so I've been busy working with another professor to get caught up... My future installments will consist of a login via sessions, and have personalized collections by user. I'm very excited to make this app awesome when I get caught up! Thank you for your patience and please let me know if you have any questions!</span>
